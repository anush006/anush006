Hey! Anush here ðŸ‘‹

I like building stuffâ€”mostly backend systems and web apps. Iâ€™ve delivered client projects, tinker with side projects, and enjoy making ideas actually work.

ðŸ’» Tech I Use: Python, C++, Java | FastAPI, Flask, Django | Supabase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

ðŸš€ Right Now: Working on client projects, experimenting with backend ideas, and learning new tech.
